	- forked original project
	- modified applet.js
		- image is now saved to {User Pictures Folder}/bingwallpaper, rather than ~/.config/bingwallpaper
		- When a new image is downloaded, the previous image and its meta.json file are moved to a subfolder named for the image date
		- (e.g. image for 02032023 is downloaded - previous image is moved to ./bingwallpaper/01032023)

	- Changed image archive naming:
		- when a new image+metadata are downloaded, the previous day's image (if present) is moved to folder <yesterday's date>
		  with a name synthesized from the image description in the copyright string.
		  e.g. if the copyright string is "Bird (Â© Owner)", the archived filename will be Bird.jpg
		  The metadata is placed alongside it, preserving copyright attribution etc (e.g. Bird.json)
