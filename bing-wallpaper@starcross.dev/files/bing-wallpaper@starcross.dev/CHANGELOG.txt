(threapUSA / Feb 09, 2023)
	- forked original project
	- modified applet.js
		- image is now saved to {User Pictures Folder}/bingwallpaper, rather than ~/.config/bingwallpaper
		- When a new image is downloaded, the previous image and its meta.json file are moved to a subfolder named for the image date
		- (e.g. image for 02032023 is downloaded - previous image is moved to ./bingwallpaper/01032023)
